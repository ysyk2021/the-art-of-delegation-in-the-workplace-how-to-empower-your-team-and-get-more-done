Integrating monitoring and evaluation strategies involves using monitoring data and evaluation feedback to inform delegation practices and adjust strategies as needed. Here are some strategies for integrating monitoring and evaluation strategies:

* Use monitoring data and evaluation feedback to identify areas for improvement in delegation practices.
* Develop action plans to address any issues or challenges identified.
* Communicate changes in delegation strategies clearly and transparently to team members.
