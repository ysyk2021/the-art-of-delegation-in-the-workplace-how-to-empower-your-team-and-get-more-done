By addressing resistance to delegation proactively, managers can build trust, empower team members, and improve overall performance.

Conflict can arise in delegation due to differences in opinions, personalities, or miscommunication. Here are some strategies for managing conflict in delegation:

* Remain calm and objective when addressing conflicts.
* Encourage open communication and active listening to understand different perspectives.
